Description: -
Based on each python step file: - 

#--Skip step 1 and step 2 because I already gave my news database. you can use yours too. or you can use step 1 and step 2 if you have your API.--#		
Step1_Get_ArticlestoTXT.py -- Getting news articles and titles.                             
Step2_ProcessJSONtoCSV.py -- Converting big JSON file into a nice CSV file with only necessary fields.  
Step3_Get_LinksForAll.py -- Getting all the connection links using NLP techniques and data processing.  
Step4_Make_Main_Graph.py -- Making a graph of all the connections. Visualizing the data most clearly.   
Step5_Get_MostInfluencedEntity.py -- Getting the most influenced entity among all.  
Step6_GetArticleFrom2Entities.py -- Getting Common connections among two entities. || Also getting article where two entities showed up in the same article.
